# Back of envelope requirements; not the most formal or templated one.
Functional requirements:
A Question & Answering AI LLM based program to -
- summarize, 
- directly quote
- provide name/title of RFC given id, 
- output id given title
- information of process
- information on authors
- information on references
- Must work for RFCs, should work for draft documents
- Language: English. Other languages TBD for future phases

UI/UX:
User Input UI/UX-
- User should be presented with simple UI for query input. 
- Ideally apart from the query itself no further input/selection options should be needed
- Multiple questions at a time and followup questions should be possible.
- Form must be able to take multiple lines. Tab/enter should work.
  
Output response UI/UX:
- Output must be directly from the relevant RFC or draft and not from other sources (precise/authentic/reliable/in-context)
- Response must be in natural language
- Must be professional in tone
- Must be polite/courteous 
- Output must be presented below the user query
- If unable to obtain the information, response needs to say as such (must not provide creative output or hallucinated output)

Scale: Skipping this for phase 1, but this may matter phase 1 as well.

Performance: Skipping this for phase 1, but this may matter as well.
