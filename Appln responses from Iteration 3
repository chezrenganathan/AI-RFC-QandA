# THIS IS JUST DOCUMENTATION OF THE RESPONSES THAT I GOT FOR DIFFERENT USER QUERIES WITH THE FULL RAG PIPELINE USED IN THE 3RD AND FINAL ITERATION
# IN THE APPLICATION'S RESPONSES BELOW BELOW FOCUS ON THE "Content" PARTS OF THE "Answer". THE API INCLUDES OTHER INFORMATION IN ITS RESPONSE.

1. question = "Can you summarize the security considerations"

Answer: ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-927kypFS4Wq8vOehdN3fCr8ZFnOOu', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(

  content='The security considerations discussed in this document pertain to MAC learning in the data plane over an Attachment Circuit (AC) and for 
           flooding of unknown unicast and ARP messages over the MPLS/IP core. It also covers MAC learning in the control plane over the MPLS/IP core. 
           The document highlights the importance of securing the control plane and protecting the forwarding path to ensure data privacy and protect 
           against denial-of-service attacks in a VPN. The document also discusses the use of BGP for the control plane and the need for techniques 
           to authenticate BGP messages to prevent spoofing updates or withdrawals. Other considerations include the need to 
           keep MPLS labels private to prevent eavesdropping on EVPN traffic, accepting MPLS labels only from valid interfaces, 
           and limiting malicious traffic into a network for an impostor MAC address.',

My assessment: !!!! THIS IS WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM A FULL RAG PIPELINE WITH LLM FOR Q&A. IT IS ABLE TO SUMMARIZE AS EXPECTED !!!!


2. question = "what are the rules to be employed to avoid mis-ordering of frames"
--------

Answer: ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-927rT3JGH0WDYti5OetelPVeFCpj5', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(
  
  content='
To avoid misordering of frames, the following rules should be applied:\n\n1. 
If a network uses deep packet inspection for its ECMP, then the "Preferred PW MPLS Control Word" [RFC4385] should be used with the value 0 
(e.g., a 4-octet field with a value of zero) when sending EVPN-encapsulated packets over an MP2P LSP.\n\n2. 
If a network uses entropy labels [RFC6790], then the control word should not be used when sending EVPN-encapsulated packets over an MP2P LSP.\n\n3. 
  When sending EVPN-encapsulated packets over a P2MP LSP or P2P LSP, then the control word should not be used.',

------
My assessment: !!!! IT HAS PICKED THE PART OF THE SECTION THAT HAS THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION !!!!


3. LETS TRY ASKING MORE SPECIFICALLY
question = "what are the rules to be employed to avoid mis-ordering of frames when sending EVPN encapsulated packets over P2MP LSP"
--------
Answer: ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-927vR9Z46mET50Ptk6gFNERgoRAaw', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(

--------
My assessment: !!! IT HAS EXTRACTED RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR THE SPECIFIC QUESTION AND IS NOT QUOTING THE WHOLE FRAME HANDLING SECTION WORD-FOR-WORD. GOOD !!!


4. LETS GO EVEN MORE SPECIFIC
question = "From frame ordering perspective what happens if the value of the first nibble happens to be 0x6"

---------
Answer: ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9284LvVXicwyuUeNojHdMxySUEIWW', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(

content='If the value of the first nibble happens to be 0x6, the Ethernet frame can be misinterpreted as an IPv6 packet 
  by intermediate P nodes performing ECMP based on deep packet inspection. This can result in load balancing packets belonging 
  to the same flow on different ECMP paths and subjecting those packets to different delays. Consequently, packets belonging to 
  the same flow can arrive at the destination out of order, impacting network operations. To avoid this, certain rules are applied, 
  such as using the "Preferred PW MPLS Control Word" with the value 0 when sending EVPN-encapsulated packets over an MP2P LSP if 
  the network uses deep packet inspection for its ECMP.',

My assessment: !!!! VERY ACCURATE, QUOTED, PLUS RESOLUTION INCLUDED !!!!


5. LETS TRY THE SUMMARIZATION QUESTION AGAIN ON A DIFFERENT SECTION
question = "Can you summarize this bgp evpn rfc"

  limitations of the existing Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) technology. These limitations include issues with
